|Agile|Waterfall|
|:---------:|:---------:|
|It separates the project development lifecycle into sprints.|Software development process is divided into distinct phases.|
|It follows an incremental approach	Waterfall methodology is a sequential design process.|Agile methodology is known for its flexibility.	Waterfall is a structured software development methodology so most times it can be quite rigid.|
|Agile can be considered as a collection of many different projects.|Software development will be completed as one single project.|
|Agile is quite a flexible method which allows changes to be made in the project development requirements even if the initial planning has been completed.|There is no scope of changing the requirements once the project development starts.|
|Agile methodology, follow an iterative development approach because of this planning, development, prototyping and other software development phases may appear more than once.|All the project development phases like designing, development, testing, etc. are completed once in the Waterfall model.|
|Test plan is reviewed after each sprint|The test plan is rarely discussed during the test phase.|
|Agile development is a process in which the requirements are expected to change and evolve.|The method is ideal for projects which have definite requirements and changes not at all expected.|
|In Agile methodology, testing is performed concurrently with software development.|In this methodology, the “Testing” phase comes after the “Build” phase|
|Agile introduces a product mindset where the software product satisfies needs of its end customers and changes itself as per the customer’s demands.|This model shows a project mindset and places its focus completely on accomplishing the project.|
|Agile methdology works exceptionally well with Time & Materials or non-fixed funding. It may increase stress in fixed-price scenarios.|Reduces risk in the firm fixed price contracts by getting risk agreement at the beginning of the process.|
|Prefers small but dedicated teams with a high degree of coordination and synchronization.|Team coordination/synchronization is very limited.|
|Products owner with team prepares requirements just about every day during a project.|Business analysis prepares requirements before the beginning of the project.|
|Test team can take part in the requirements change without problems.|It is difficult for the test to initiate any change in requirements.|
|Description of project details can be altered anytime during the SDLC process.|Detail description needs to implement waterfall software development approach.|
|The Agile Team members are interchangeable, as a result, they work faster. There is also no need for project managers because the projects are managed by the entire team|In the waterfall method, the process is always straightforward so, project manager plays an essential role during every stage of SDLC.|
